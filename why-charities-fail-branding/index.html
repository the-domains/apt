<p>There is no charity, not-for-profit or social enterprise in Interbrand's top 100 brands. To me, that says a lot. In fact, I doubt that one would even show up in the top 200. Crazy! Every organisation is a brand, if you don't think so then give me a call and I'll buy you a coffee.</p><p>A brand strategy is made up of vision, mission, promise, values, positioning, what, how and why. Who should have the most meaningful visions and reasons for being? Yep, you guessed it - charities, not-for-profits and social enterprises. But they don't, and subsequently most of them fail to communicate effectively, most of them are caught up in what they do, all for good and obvious reasons, but do you know what? I don't care what you do. I care about why you do it. Commercial profits dwarf charity donations.</p><p>The best brands (all commercial remember) understand that they need an emotional attachment with their customers, they value these relationships and yet they are selling you stuff that doesn't really matter. I get more delight and pleasure out of buying/using something that bears no goodness beyond myself. Yet if we look at the original definitions of philanthropy we find the writers talk about the great pleasure that is derived from giving and being part of something bigger than just ourselves; they talk about it in terms of a holistic health and life. Oh and by the way, top brands have realised this and now try to align themselves with something more meaningful. Although, I do believe that many top brands were started with a good heart and desire. The difference is how this is inherently communicated through the brand. Look at the latest Santander ads. - this is a bank! I'm sure Jensen Button is actually smiling.</p><p>Ok so let's talk about money, doesn't branding cost loads of money!? <em>'I can't spend our donors/supporters money on this, it doesn't benefit our mission!'</em> Firstly that's fear talking. Never operate out of fear. How much would you give to see your vision realised? If it's not everything, stop what you're doing now and go drive a train, at least you'll be going somewhere.</p><p>Usually ROI from branding takes time, but since most charities are in a branding mess and since we offer appropriate prices, ROI can be realised quite quickly. Let me show you... Two of our clients within 6 months of working with us have seen a return of between 5 & 11 times on their investment - er hello!.. New revenue streams, through confident communications has inspired sponsorship and constituent engagement. One of our clients saw a 60% increase in this years undergraduate enrolment, that kind of number is unheard of in higher education since it an extremely competitive market.</p><p>I want to set a challenge, let's see if we can get a 'for good' organisation into the top 100 of brands within the next ten years. If you're up for it, let me know. If you've got more modest aspirations then come along to our Free Brand Surgery for Charities and we'll help you with your challenges.</p><p><a href="http://trulyapt.com/events/2016/3/2/free-charity-brand-surgery-event">Sign up here</a></p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="25"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="27"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="28"><span data-reactid="29"><!-- react-empty: 30 --><h2 data-reactid="31"><a data-reactid="32">Apt</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="34"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="35"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="36"></div></section></div></div>
